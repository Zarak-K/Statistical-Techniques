The purpose of these notebooks is to show how the validity of different models can be assessed when fit to a dataset. This is important as the parameters of a well-fit model can reveal relationships between the quantities under investigation. Additionally, models can provide predictive power over the outcomes of unseen data.
The dataset used in "Bootstrapping.ipynb" relates to the activity of a radioactive isotope as a function of time. An exponential decay fit is applied to the data with free parameters of initial activity and decay constant. Bootstrapping is used to estimate best fit parameters and uncertainties, and the isotope is identified by calculating its half-life from the best fit decay constant.
